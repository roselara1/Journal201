#Journal 2#

Tonight I decided to continue to review my About Me expanded code. I had **a lot** of difficulty getting the loop to work. When I first completed the code, without the loop, everything ran fine. But once I put the loops in, it kept giving me errors. I took another 2 hours trying to figure out where I went wrong. Looking at other people's code online only showed me a lot of functions, which I can\'t use. So hoping for the best, I decided to wait to get to class and see if someone else might have figured it out. It is not the best option, and I hope to be able to figure things out in the future. Some of my goals for the upcoming week are:

1. To get my game up and running with a for or while loop (and no function)
2. To practice creating the game again by re-typing the code. Usually writing/typing things out helps me remember them better
3. To go try to find a co-working meetup on Sunday or Friday that happens south of Seattle. The commute to Seattle is very long for me but I would like to meet other people on work on my code on days where I do not have class.
