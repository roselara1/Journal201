I find that writing JavaScript comes with a few problems that aren't really related to the code itself.
The issue I seem to have is not knowing why we use certain words instead of others. It would be nice
to have a vocabulary list that explains the why and how they function instead of "We use this for this
lab". The readings in the HTML CSS have great summaries but the JavaScript assignments were so long that
it was difficult to grasp everything.
