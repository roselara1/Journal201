Dear Salmon Cookies,
I have you.

I feel like I will get hired and immediately have a Salmon Cookie style project handed to me.
That is literally my biggest fear.
Can I ask if I will have to develop a responsive table at any point during my interviews?
Too specific?

Looking forward to our project though. I know I have an amazing team!
