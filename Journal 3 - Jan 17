After working together with someone it ended up being a great lesson. I was able to look at my code and actually SEE the 
mistakes very easily. Even before my partner could say what errors I had, I already found them. It was fun to see someone
else and how they work through their code as well. I think I learned that being able to sit down, and read your code out loud
is a great way to see where you went wrong. Another person stated something that also helped me find a lot of things faster,
he said that we usually look for a giraffe when it is just a horse that we really need to find. Meaning, it is usually 
something so simple and easy but we think it should be something difficult and exotic.
